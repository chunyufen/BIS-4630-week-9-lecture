# Study hours outside class contact

&gt; “The study hours for each credit point is 10 hours. For a 30-credit module this equates to 300 hours. Therefore, if a module has time-tabled activities i.e. lecture/seminar/lab, of 3 hours per week for a 24-week period (total of 72 hours), then the out-of-class study commitment expected of students is 228 hours in total.” - Course Handbook.

* Practical meaning: 300 hours = **2.5 hours per day** x *5 days* x 24 learning weeks (Note: only 18 learning weeks for Hong Kong)

---

# Master's degree in UK

&gt; “[A] master's [degree] is hard work and requires a lot of commitment. It has to be something you actively want to do . . . Postgraduate study is *much more independent* than undergraduate study, so, on a practical level, it is important to be aware that you may be *working by yourself for much of the time*.” - [Taking the plunge into the master's world (The Guardian, 2009)](http://bit.ly/2fBScEa)

# Offences

* giving or offering a bribe

* receiving a bribe

* bribery of a public official

* corporation failure to prevent bribery

---

# Offences

* giving or offering a bribe

    + "Regardless of whether or not it is accepted. It is an offence to give or promise to give any advantage, including cash, or gifts, to induce a person to perform their role improperly."

---

# Offences

* receiving a bribe

    + "It is an offence for a person or party to seek, take or agree to take any advantage in return for their improper conduct or influence."

---

# Offences

* bribery of a public official

    + "It is an offence to attempt to influence a public official with the promise of cash, gifts, or hospitality in order to obtain an advantage in business."
---

# Offences

* corporation failure to prevent bribery

    + "If a company falls to prevent a bribe being paid on its behalf, the company will have committed this corporate offence, regardless of whether or not it was aware of it. The bribe could come from an employee or an individual associated with the company."

---

# Guidance

* The Ministry of Justice provides [guidance](http://bit.ly/1U6pHxi) for companies on adequate procedures to prevent bribery. This is based on 6 principles:

    + Proportionate procedures

    + Top-level commitment

    + Risk assessment

    + Due diligence

    + Communication

    + Monitoring and review

---

# Guidance

* Proportionate procedures

    + "Company procedures should be proportionate to the risk of bribery. This will depend on the scale and complexity of the company's business activities. The procedure should be easily accessible, clear, practical and possible to implement and enforce effectively."

---

# Guidance

* Top-level commitment

    + "At the highest level, the management of a company should adopt a zero tolerance policy to bribery and corruption. Management should commit to preventing bribery occurring by anyone associated with the company."

---

# Guidance

* Risk assessment

    + "Organisations should assess the nature and extent of their exposure to risk of bribery."

---

# Guidance

* Due diligence

    + "To mitigate identified bribery risks, organisations should apply due diligence procedures with respect to all persons performing services for them or on their behalf."

---

# Guidance

* Communication

    + "Communication is key to preventing bribery. Companies and organisations should embed their bribery prevention policies and ensure they are clearly understood throughout the organisation."

---

# Guidance

* Monitoring and review

    + "Organisations should monitor and review their bribery prevention procedures, and involve all associates of the company. Improvements should then be made where necessary."

---

# How to recognise legal and illegal activity

&gt; "Bribery is the act of offering anything beneficial or of value while intending to influence a person to perform their role improperly, or accepting anything beneficial or of value to perform your role improperly."

&gt; "The Bribery Act states that the person or persons involved in the bribe must have a guilty mind; that is, they intend or know their act will result in improper conduct. If a gift is offered with no impropriety intended, then it is not a bribe."

---

# Typical bribes

* Bribes in business are typically used for:

    + obtaining or retaining business

    + gaining an advantage over competitors

    + influencing an official in his performance or official function

---

# Types of bribes

* Bribery takes many guises:

    + gifts: "This includes products, services cash and vouchers"

    + excessive hospitality: "lavish gifts, hospitality or entertainment"

    + charitable donations: "These can be political or otherwise, and may include pro bono services."

    + facilitation payments: "Sometimes called grease payments, these are above and beyond any legitimate payment due."

# Paradise Papers Investigation

---

# [Video: How to hide your cash offshore](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-41880153#)

* How to hide your cash offshore

1. Create a company in name only or shell company
1. Base it somewhere
    + offshore
    + with low or zero-tax
    +  high levels of secrecy
    +  such as the Cayman Islands, the Bristish Virgin Islands, Burmada, the Isle of Man, Guernsey, the Channel Island of Jersey
1. Pay some nominees to "run" the business to avoid your name appearing on documents
1. Open a bank account in another offshore location for extra anonymity. THe shell company makes payments into this account.
2. Spend the money on "company assets" or loans you will never pay back

* One estimate of the amount held in offshore financial centres is $10 trillion (citing Boston Consulting Group). That's similar to the combined economic output of Japan, the UK and France.

# [Where do the Paradise Papers come from?](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-41880153)

&gt; "There are more than 1,400GB of data, containing about 13.4 million documents. Some 6.8 million come from the offshore legal service provider *Appleby* and corporate services provider *Estera*. The two operated together under the Appleby name until Estera became independent in 2016. Another six million documents come from corporate registries in some 19 jurisdictions, mostly in the Caribbean. A smaller amount comes from the Singapore-based international trust and corporate services provider, Asiaciti Trust. The leaked data covers seven decades, from 1950 to 2016."

---

# [Who leaked the Paradise Papers?](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-41880153)

&gt; "As with 2016's Panama Papers, *German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung* obtained the original material and was the stepping off point for this investigation. In the case of the Panama Papers, the originator of the leaks, named only as John Doe, issued a manifesto a month after the publication date. A simple statement this time says: "For their protection, Süddeutsche Zeitung does as a general policy not comment on its sources!""

---

# [Who is working on the leaks?](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-41880153)

&gt; "As with the Panama Papers, the *International Consortium of Investigative Journalists*, a global network of investigative journalists, was called in to work on the project. Along with the BBC's flagship Panorama programme, there are nearly 100 media partners involved in 67 countries, including the Guardian and the New York Times."

---

# [The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists](https://www.icij.org/about/)

&gt; "The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists is a global network of more than 200 investigative journalists in 70 countries who collaborate on in-depth investigative stories.

&gt; Founded in 1997 by the respected American journalist Chuck Lewis, ICIJ was launched as a project of the Center for Public Integrity, focusing on issues that do not stop at national frontiers: cross-border crime, corruption, and the accountability of power."

&gt; "The ICIJ is a non-profit organization. We give our work away for free."

---

# [Paradise Papers](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-41880153)

&gt; "As with last year's Panama Papers leak, the documents were obtained by the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, which called in the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) to oversee the investigation. BBC Panorama and the Guardian are among the nearly 100 media groups investigating the papers.

&gt; The Paradise Papers name was chosen because of the idyllic profiles of many of the offshore jurisdictions whose workings are unveiled, including Bermuda, the HQ of the main company involved, Appleby. It also dovetails nicely with the French term for a tax haven - paradis fiscal. Then again, the Isle of Man plays a big part."

---

# [The paradise papers investigation](https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/about/)

&gt; "The Paradise Papers is a global investigation into the offshore activities of some of the world’s most powerful people and companies.

&gt; The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and 95 media partners explored 13.4 million leaked files from a combination of offshore service providers and the company registries of some of the world’s most secretive countries.

&gt; The files were obtained by the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung.

&gt; The Paradise Papers documents include nearly 7 million loan agreements, financial statements, emails, trust deeds and other paperwork from nearly 50 years at Appleby, a leading offshore law firm with offices in Bermuda and beyond.

---

# [The paradise papers investigation](https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/about/)

&gt; The documents also include files from a smaller, family-owned trust company, Asiaciti, and from company registries in 19 secrecy jurisdictions. The records range from complex, 100-page corporate transaction sheets and dollar-by-dollar payment ledgers to simple corporate registries of countries, such as Antigua &amp; Barbuda, that do not publicly list names of company shareholders or directors."

# Global corruption is a major problem

* Secrecy provided by offshore companies may be facilitating corruption right around the world

*  [International Monetary Fund](http://bit.ly/2lw9swJ) has said that bribery alone costs as much as two per cent of global GDP

* [The Puppet Masters: How the Corrupt Use Legal Structures to
Hide Stolen Assets and What to Do About It](http://bit.ly/2lzrBcb): "70 per cent of the grand corruption cases reviewed relied on secret company ownership."

* [Global Financial Integrity](http://bit.ly/1kAw5tM): illicit financial flows, which include the proceeds of corruption, are costing developing countries over US$1 trillion every year.

* [Guidance on Corporate Prosecutions](http://bit.ly/2iOno4Q)

* Additional public interest factors against prosecution

    + "A prosecutor should take into account the commercial consequences of a relevant conviction under European law, particularly for self-referring companies, in ensuring that any outcome is proportionate. "

    + "A genuinely proactive approach adopted by the corporate management team when the offending is brought to their notice, involving self-reporting and remedial actions, including the compensation of victims: In applying this factor the prosecutor needs to establish whether sufficient information about the operation of the company in its entirety has been supplied in order to assess whether the company has been proactively compliant. This will include making witnesses available and disclosure of the details of any internal investigation;"

# *Regina v. Innospect Limited*

* [(2010) EW Misc 7 (EWCC) (18 March 2010)](http://bit.ly/2jact2f)

* sentencing judgment (not appellate)

* Judge criticised SFO

&gt; "The court was faced with an agreement made between the DOJ, the SEC, the OFAC and SFO as to the division of the sum these bodies had considered Innospec was able to pay. This was not a matter that received judicial determination in either the UK or the US (save that inherent in the Federal District Court's approval of the plea agreement). As it is the position in both the US and the UK that it is for the court ultimately to determine the sanction to be imposed for the criminal conduct, an agreement between prosecutors as to the division, even if . . . "

---

# *Regina v. Innospect Limited*

* Judge criticised SFO

&gt; ". . . an agreement between prosecutors as to the division, even if it had been within the power of the Director of the SFO (which as I have explained it was not), cannot be in accordance with basic constitutional principles. Nor in my view was the division agreed one which on the facts of the case accorded with principle. The gravamen of the criminality was centred in the UK, the criminality of the corruption in Indonesia was no less serious than that in Iraq and there was no reason to prefer compensation to Iraq over compensation to both Iraq and Indonesia."

---

# *Regina v. Innospect Limited*

* Judge further criticised SFO

&gt; "However there is a more important general principle. Those who commit such serious crimes as corruption of senior foreign government officials must not be viewed or treated in any different way to other criminals. It will therefore rarely be appropriate for criminal conduct by a company to be dealt with by means of a civil recovery order; the criminal courts can take account of co operation and the provision of evidence against others by reducing the fine otherwise payable. . . . "

---

# *Regina v. Innospect Limited*

* Judge further criticised SFO

&gt; ". . . It is of the greatest public interest that the serious criminality of any, including companies, who engage in the corruption of foreign governments, is made patent for all to see by the imposition of criminal and not civil sanctions. It would be inconsistent with basic principles of justice for the criminality of corporations to be glossed over by a civil as opposed to a criminal sanction. There may, of course, be a place for a civil order, for example, as a means of compensation in addition to a fine. It is therefore plainly desirable that the Lord Chief Justice should consider directions that ensure any civil penalties are heard in conjunction with criminal proceedings."

* First case of a global settlement in respect of criminal proceedings in both the UK and US.

* The agreement: paragraphs 15 - 21

&gt; "Innospec Ltd is an English company and a subsidiary of Innospec Inc, a US company. Investigations of the Innospec entities by the US and UK indicated that Innospec Ltd had paid bribes totalling an estimated US$8m to government officials in Indonesia and that Innospec Inc had bribed government officials in Iraq. Discussions between the SFO in the UK and the SEC, OFAC and the DOJ in the US, and the Innospec entities resulted in an agreement that the Innospec entities should plead guilty to charges relating to corruption and pay predetermined penalties. . . ."

# *Regina v. Innospect Limited*

* The agreement: paragraphs 15 - 21

&gt; ". . . It was agreed that Innopsec Ltd would pay a third of the total amount, ie US$12.7m. Although a higher amount could have been sought, the US and UK authorities agreed to accept the reduced penalties in light of the group's co-operation and the fact a larger penalty would bankrupt the companies."

* Duties of UK Prosecutor: paragraphs 22 - 29

---

# Questions

* Serious nature of corruption offences means that criminal sanctions are the only appropriate sanctions. But SFO indicated that self-reporting may result in non-prosecution.

* But SFO indicated that section 7 should not trigger debarment from public contract.

# [Joint Prosecution Guidance of SFO and DPP (30 March 2011)](http://bit.ly/2hWDytA)

* Factors tending against prosecution (section 1)

&gt; "There has been a genuinely proactive approach involving self-reporting and remedial action (additional factor (a) in the Guidance on Corporate Prosecutions)"

* Factors tending against prosecution (section 6)

&gt; "The payment(s) came to light as a result of a genuinely proactive approach involving self-reporting and remedial action (additional factor (a) in the Guidance on Corporate Prosecutions)"

# [SFO Corporate Self-reporting Policy (October 2012)](http://bit.ly/2iKoRqI)

* Supersedes any statement of policy or practice on self-reporting previously made by or on behalf of SFO

---

# SFO Corporate Self-reporting Policy (October 2012)

&gt; "Whether or not the SFO will prosecute a corporate body in a given case will be governed by the Full Code Test in the [Code for Crown Prosecutors](http://bit.ly/1lb0oEo), the joint prosecution [Guidance on Corporate Prosecutions](http://bit.ly/2iOno4Q) and, where relevant, the [Joint Prosecution Guidance of the Director of the SFO and the Director of Public Prosecutions on the Bribery Act 2010](http://bit.ly/2hWDytA)."

---

# SFO Corporate Self-reporting Policy (October 2012)

* Consideration of self-reporting

&gt; "If on the evidence there is a realistic prospect of conviction, the SFO will prosecute if it is in the public interest to do so. The fact that a corporate body has reported itself will be a relevant consideration to the extent set out in the Guidance on Corporate Prosecutions. That Guidance explains that, for a self-report to be taken into consideration as a public interest factor tending against prosecution, it must form part of a "genuinely proactive approach adopted by the corporate management team when the offending is brought to their notice". Self-reporting is no guarantee that a prosecution will not follow. Each case will turn on its own facts."

(BBA)

---

# Section 7

* Failure of a relevant commercial organisation to prevent bribery

    + "Under section 7 of the Act, a commercial organisation can also be found guilty of an offence if a person associated with the organisation bribes another, intending to obtain or retain business or a business advantage for that organisation." (HR)

    + "It creates an additional direct rather than alternative vicarious liability, when the commission of a section 1 or section 6 bribery offence has taken place on behalf of an organisation." (HR)

---

* Failure of a relevant commercial organisation to prevent bribery
    (section 7): relevant commercial organisation (section 7(5))

    + "a body which is incorporated under the law of any part of the United Kingdom and which carries on a business (whether there or elsewhere)"

    + "Accordingly A may (for example) be C's employee, agent or *subsidiary*."

    + "Whether or not A is a person who performs services for or on behalf of C is to be determined by reference to all the relevant circumstances and not merely by reference to the nature of the relationship between A and C."

    + "But if A is an employee of C, it is to be presumed unless the contrary is shown that A is a person who performs services for or on behalf of C"

---

# Jurisdiction

* Failure of a relevant commercial organisation to prevent bribery
    (section 7)

    + "It is also worth noting that for the offence to be made out there is no requirement to prove that the activity was committed in the UK or elsewhere. Indeed, there is no need to even show a close connection to the UK as is needed for the other bribery offences under the Act." (HR)

---

# Attributing crimes to companies

* Summary: Three questions for section 7

    + Has bribery occured by a person?

    + Is the person an employee of the company?

    + Has the company failed to prevent that person from committing bribery?

---

# Attributing crimes to companies

* Failure of a relevant commercial organisation to prevent bribery
    (section 7)

    + "Moreover, the existence of section 7 does not affect the common law principle that governs the liability of corporate bodies for criminal offences." (HR)

---

# Attributing crimes to companies

* Nature of companies

    + "The company having a legal personality separate from its shareholders and managers, yet being an artificial person, has often caused difficulties in finding the company directly liable for criminal acts." (JM)

    + "English law treats a company as a legal person or entity in its own right and not as an aggregate of shareholders. Incorporation gives the company legal personality, separate from its members, with the result that a company may own property, sue and be sued in its own corporate name." (JM)

---

# Attributing crimes to companies

* Nature of companies

    + "In the context of crimes, the premise of separate legal personality is that the entity cannot, ordinarily, be liable for crimes of its members and equally the converse." (JM)

    + "Moreover, ordinarily, common law and statutory criminal offences require proof of a criminal mind, yet it is difficult to show a criminal mind of a company, for the artificial person has no mind of its own as does the natural person." (JM)

---

# Attributing crimes to companies

* Doctrine of identification or attribution

    + "To apply attribution rules to bribes, the personnel with whom the company is identified would only include those at the centre of corporate power ? the board of directors, the managing director and perhaps other senior personnel who carry out the functions of management and speak and act as the company." (JM)

    + "As bribery generally happens in the lower hierarchy of corporations or institutions, relying on attribution for corporate crimes poses considerable difficulties. The BA goes beyond attribution rules to avoid their limitations." (JM)

---

# Bribery by company

* Section 7 (associated person of company committing section 1 or section 6)

* Sections 1 and 6: Doctrine of identification or attribution (directing mind committing section 1 or section 6)

    + "This common law principle, sometimes referred to as the "identification principle", will therefore continue to operate so that where there is evidence to prove that a person who is properly regarded as representing the "directing mind" of the body in question possessed the necessary fault element required for the offence charged the corporate body may be proceeded against." (MoJCir)

---

# Section 7 Defences

* It is a defence if the company can prove that it had in place "adequate procedures" designed to prevent persons associated with the company from bribing another person.

* The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities (G)

* Ministry of Justice published guidance to explain "adequate procedures"

    + [Guidance on good practice procedures for corporate anti-bribery programmes](http://bit.ly/2CwnoOs).

    + [Guidance on good practice procedures for corporate anti-bribery programmes: Checklist](http://bit.ly/2ltuV9C)

* (defences in details to be explained in another session.)

---

# General defences to sections 1, 2 and 7 and their inchoate offences

* Section 13 (1):

    + It is a defence for a person charged with a relevant bribery offence to prove that the person's conduct was necessary for:

         + (a) the proper exercise of any function of an intelligence service, or

         + (b) the proper exercise of any function of the armed forces when engaged on active service.

* Section 13(6):

    + defines relevant bribery offences, etc.

* Purpose:

    + enable the intelligence services, or the armed forces to undertake legitimate functions that may require the use of a financial or other advantage to accomplish the relevant function
